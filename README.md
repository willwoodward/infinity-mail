### Infinity Mail
##### Project Information
This email client aims to integrate AI with your emails. Currently, you can fetch emails from your gmail inbox, and summarise those emails.

##### Setting Up
- Make sure you have docker and docker compose installed
- Run `docker-compose -f dev.compose.yaml up`

This will start the project in development mode, requiring no further setup.

Currently, the GCP App has to whitelist users, so if you'd like to me to whitelist your account, get in touch.
